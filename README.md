## Architecture

**General**: HMKIT Crypto C is pure c cryptography layer implementation based on OpenSSL. 

**Crypto.c**: This contains the OpenSSL implementation.

**Crypto.h**: This is the library header file that is needed to conform to the HMKit Core cryptographic abstraction layer.

**commandline**: This is a test and example application for HMKit Crypto C.

## Requirements

HMKit Crypto C is based on OpenSSL 1.1.0
